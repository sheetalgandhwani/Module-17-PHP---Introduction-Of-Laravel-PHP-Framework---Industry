                              PHP - Introduction Of Laravel PHP Framework - Industry
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Introduction to Laravel PHP Framework

  

     Laravel is an open-source PHP framework used to build websites and apps. It contains all the necessary components and features to help web
       developers create a website using the PHP scripting language. It is important to note that Laravel isn’t the only framework 
        available to PHP developers. In fact, other popular PHP frameworks include Symfony, CodeIgniter. And if we venture outside the PHP zone,
          there’s even more frameworks available, such as Rails which is based on the Ruby language, .NET which uses C#, 
          or Sails.js, a JavaScript framework.

      Just like most popular web frameworks, Laravel follows a model-view-controller (MVC) approach to development. This simply means that the    
           development process is broken down into three main components:

     Model:   How data is handled and maintained on the site or app.

     View:   This is the visual representation of the data, or in other words the UI (user interface). This bit will be mostly handled by 
             HTML/CSS.
            Examples of UI elements may include drop-downs, charts, text boxes and tables.      

   Controller:  As the name suggests, it controls the data shown to the user. When a user interacts with the site/app, it will retrieve the  
                 relevant  data from the model and then display it to the user using the view component.


       ** Key Features of Laravel:
      ============================

    1. Elegant Syntax: Laravel offers a clean and simple syntax that makes web development more accessible and enjoyable.

    3. Artisan CLI:  Laravel includes a command-line interface (CLI) called Artisan, which provides a number of helpful 
       ------------   commands for application development. 

    4. Eloquent ORM:   Laravel’s Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows developers to interact with databases using
      -------------    an expressive and fluent syntax. 

   5.Blade Templating Engine:  Laravel’s Blade templating engine provides powerful features like template inheritance and
     ------------------------    sections, which help in building dynamic layouts.

     ---------     cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and cross-site scripting (XSS).

   7.Authentication and Authorization: Laravel makes implementing authentication and authorization very straightforward.
    ---------------------------------

   8. Task Scheduling: The framework provides a fluent interface for defining and scheduling tasks.

   9. Queues and Background Jobs: Laravel provides a unified API for different queue backends, allowing background processing  
      -------------------------------    of time-consuming tasks.

   10.RESTful APIs: Building RESTful APIs is straightforward with Laravel, thanks to its resource controllers and built-in 
      -------------   tools for JSON responses and API authentication.




       ** Laravel 11.x
       ===================
